This code repository holds the scripts for the experiments performed in our paper "Performance Estimation in Binary Classification Using Calibrated Confidence"

To run the TableShift experiments, you will have to download the data from https://tinyurl.com/tableshift

Unzip the tableshift data into a subfolder named "tableshift_data" in the working directory.
